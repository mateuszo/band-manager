# band-manager
This is a Django web application for music bands to manage their recordings, compositions and rhersals

It lets you group your recordings into events (e.g. gigs, regersals) and projects (e.g. compositions, songs). 
Image below presents the domain diagram of this application.

This project is in it's early development stage. However I found it very useful for the purposes of my own band.
