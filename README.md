# band-manager
This is a Django web application for music bands to manage their recordings, compositions and rehearsal

It lets you group your recordings/tracks into events (e.g. gigs, rehearsal) and projects (e.g. compositions, songs).
Image below presents the domain diagram of this application.

This project is in it's early development stage. However I found it very useful for the purposes of my own band.
